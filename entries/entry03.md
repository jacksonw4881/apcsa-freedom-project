## Engineering Design Process:
For the past few weeks, I have shifted most of my focus from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/docs) to creating the content of my app. Knowing that there will be a considerable amount of content that I will create since I want to be as specific as possible with everything about [PUBG](https://documentation.pubg.com/en/index.html), and that content will take up the most amount of work as opposed to tinkering with Android Studio, I have decided to halt the learning process of Android Studio and focused more on creating the content of my app on a [Google Doc](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). I also did this because I prefer to be consistent with the project by focusing on one thing at a time, rather than being inconsistent and bouncing from creating the content and tinkering with Android Studio. I've also been playing PUBG more often so that I can see what tips and other things I can find to include in my app, since most of the content is from my own personal experience of playing the game. Lastly, I have recorded and edited all of the gun audio from PUBG for my PUBG gun sound quiz with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/help/documentation/).
