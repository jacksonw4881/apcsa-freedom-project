## Engineering Design Process
Currently, I am on step 5 on the Engineering Design Process, which is creating a prototype. I have created multiple buttons that the user can choose to click on based on what the user wants to see and when the user clicks on the button, it will open to a new screen with different texts. I have learned how to do this with the [Android Developer Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/button) and some help on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-2fOVxYPSA). This interaction is a big component of my app since my app will have many buttons that the user can click on to see what tip the user wants to see. Although I would like to include some more content that might be helpful for the user, I have realized it is better to actually start coding the app on Android Studio to fulfill the Minimum Viable Product, as it is better to have an app that works rather than no app with a bunch of extra content.

## Knowledge

We first have to create a button on activity_main.xml for the button to show on the main screen by dragging a button from the palette to the design layout. This is the code on the text editor of activity_main.xml when we add the button onto the screen.

```
<Button
        android:id="@+id/gunguide"
        android:layout_width="418dp"
        android:layout_height="92dp"
        android:text="Gun Guide"
        tools:layout_editor_absoluteX="-8dp"
        tools:layout_editor_absoluteY="-3dp" />
```
