##### Small update from entry 1:
I've decided to create a very in depth PUBG Guide Java app that gives people tips and tricks about the game based on my own experience of playing the game. This will be the PC version of PUBG because it's harder to play and it's more competitive than the mobile version. I will also create a multiple choice gun sound quiz where when a user clicks on a button, it will create a gun noise, and the user would have to choose which gun it is. In the game, knowing what gun the enemy has based on the gun sound when they shoot is important since it allows you to be aware of what kind of gun you are dealing with.

## Why Java?
Since APCSA is centered towards Java, I feel like it would be most viable to have as much knowledge and experience in Java as possible thoughout the school year by making my freedom project java based rather than making it based on another programming language.
## Tools
Knowing that java is only compatible with Android and not really for iOS, I began searching up tools that will help me create this app for android. The tool that I have stumbled upon and decided to use was [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). For my gun sound quiz, I've decided to use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to record and edit gun audio from the game. I've been looking at [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9YblXBQ5uU) for Android Studio but I don't need a tutorial for Audacity since I've used it in the past.
## Where am I at currently?
Right now, I've been getting used to the Android Studio IDE. I've been trying to become familiar with the Android Studio IDE rather than just jumping in and create something without being familiar with the setting of the IDE. I've also been recording and editing many gun sounds for my gun quiz and plan out the content of my guide on a google doc.
## Knowledge and Skills
Everything that I will learn in APCSA will contribute to the making of my app. Currently, we are learning methods, which is something that I will most likely implement in my app since methods are efficient at reusing code and seperate code based on the name of the method. Since I am going solo on this project, I need to make sure I manage my time carefully and consistently work on this at least every other day.
