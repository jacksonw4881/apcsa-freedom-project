### Intro
---
Every friday, students in APCSA work on a year long project of a topic of their choosing.

### Context
---
After some thought, I've narrowed my decision to three options: Learn SQL and Firebase and partner up with someone that's making an app that requires a database, make an app entirely out of Java that doesn't require a database, or go all out and learn SQL and Firebase and make an app entirely out of Java that requires a database. Unfortunately, I've realized that I couldn't just solely work on SQL and firebase for my project since both SQL and firebase is used for the sake of storing data. I'm a little inclined to do the second or third option because I perfer being autonomous when working with projects, but I am opened for the first option if anyone wants to work with me. If I'm not doing the first option, then I have yet to think of an intuitive app to make but no worries! I promise I'll think of an idea before next friday.
