## Engineering Design Process

I am on step 7 on the Engineering Design Process, improve as needed. Since I have already completed the MVP, I had been working on my Gun Sound Quiz. I have been mostly using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiCZQg4mhBQ) and its corresponding parts to help me on my gun sound quiz. However, the biggest problem with this is that I wanted the score to update everytime the user chose the correct answer, but this required learning SQLite, so I used [this website](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) to try to learn SQLite. In addition, my quiz is unique since I want the sound of the button to change after the end of each question. I tried looking for a way to make the button gun sound update after the end of each question through multiple sources like Youtube, Stack Overflow, etc, but there was absolutely nothing that helped, so I decided to just scrap the idea and create an activity that showcases gun sounds.

## Knowledge

Inheritance is used in my app to interconnect classes together and make the fluidity of the code more coherant to read. Also, the accessor and the mutator methods (also known as the getter and setter methods) enabled me to get variables and set variables with ease.

## Skills

I had improved my **Growth Mindset** skill by making sure that I was consistent will everything. I was burnout during the pandemic, but I realized that I should use this free time to my own benefit rather than just waste it away. I also improved **How to Google** by putting the word "sound", "quiz", and "app" into CTRL F and going through websites, like Stack Overflow, in order to solve my problem more efficently.
